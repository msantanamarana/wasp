# Wasp

Wasp is an embeddable micro-hypervisor designed to support _virtines_, lightweight,
isolated execution contexts for individual functions. Virtines can either be created
manually by invoking a runtime API, or automatically by using our Clang/LLVM compiler
extensions. In the latter case, a develper can create a virtine by simply adding
a keyword to a C function:

```C
virtine int foo (int arg) {
    // code
} 
```

## Paper
* [Isolating Functions at the Hardware Limit with Virtines](https://nickw.io/papers/eurosys22.pdf)<br>
Nicholas C. Wanninger, Joshua J. Bowden, Kyle C. Hale<br>
The 17th European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys '22, to appear)

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- `nasm`
- `libcurl` dev headers (`libcurl-dev` on ubuntu)
- Must be on a Linux box with KVM support (`lsmod | grep kvm`)


Tested on a chameleon cloud ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (baremetal skylake, 48 cores, xeon gold 6126) kernel version 5.4.0-91-generic
```bash
sudo apt install cmake nasm llvm llvm-dev clang
git clone https://github.com/virtines/wasp.git
cd wasp
make
sudo make install
make smoketest
```

If the smoketest doesn't panic, wasp works!

## Building and Installing

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Yeah its pretty easy.

## Using

Just include it as a shared library when building:

```bash
clang++ -lwasp main.cpp -o main
```
